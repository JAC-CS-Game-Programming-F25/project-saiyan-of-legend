# Final Project

-   [x] Read the [project requirements](https://vikramsinghmtl.github.io/420-5P6-Game-Programming/project/requirements).
-   [x] Replace the sample proposal below with the one for your game idea.
-   [ ] Get the proposal greenlit by Vik.
-   [ ] Place any assets in `assets/` and remember to update `src/config.json`.
-   [ ] Decide on a height and width inside `src/globals.js`. The height and width will most likely be determined based on the size of the assets you find.

# Dragon Ball Fighting Game - Project Proposal

## ✒️ Description

In this 2-player fighting game inspired by Dragon Ball Z, two legendary saiyans face off in an epic battle to determine who is the strongest. Players control their fighters using a combination of melee attacks, three unique special moves, and defensive blocking. The arena features platforms, requiring players to master their character's attacks to know which attack to use and when. Victory is achieved by depleting the opponent's health bar through the use of attacks, and special moves.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

Two players face each other in a single-screen arena with a platform. Each fighter starts with 100 HP displayed via health bars at the top of the screen. Players can move freely left and right, jump to avoid attacks, and attack the other player.

**Combat System:**  
The basic melee attack is a quick punch that deals damage with a short-range hitbox directly in front of the fighter. This attack has minimal startup time, making it ideal for quick exchanges and combo pressure.

**Special Attacks:**  
Fighters can reach different levels of Super Saiyan and deal massive amount of damage to their opponent.

**Defense:**  
Players can hold the block button to enter a defensive stance, reducing all incoming damage by 50%. However, blocking prevents movement, creating a risk-reward dynamic. Fighters must decide when to block and when to evade.

**Damage & Knockback:**  
When hit (and not blocking), fighters get stunned. This prevents infinite combos and creates spacing between fighters.

**Victory Conditions:**  
The first player to reduce their opponent's health to zero wins the match. Upon victory, the winner is displayed on a victory screen with option to return to the title screen.

The game is played entirely with keyboard controls, with Player 1 using WASD + E/Q/1/2/3/ and Player 2 using IJKL + O/U/7/8/9.
